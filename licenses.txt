Participation in workshops is based upon licenses.
A client will purchase 10 licenses for the 101 class
and can then have 10 participants attend the class, 
using one license per attendant.

1. Licenses are added to the client file in the database
    a. These licenses are directly linked to the course they will be used on,
        but a separate "license type" could be implemented to give greater flexibility
        for example, one license that may count toward a 101, 102, 201, or 202 workshop 

2. Two numbers for the licenses will be tracked, along with a log of changes:
    a. Remaining Amount - how many licenses are available for new requests. 
        Pending is not included in this
    b. Pending - licenses reserved for an upcoming workshop. These have technically 
        not been reconciled yet, as the workshop is yet to complete,
        but they can be considered reserved and should not be considered available

3. A workshop is requested. The server will check for a sufficient number of 
    "Remaining Amount" licenses against the class size and reject the request 
    if the client does not have enough available

4. Assuming there are enough licenses, the amount of the class size of 
    the workshop will be removed from the Remaining Amount and added to Pending

5. Once the workshop is finalized, the adjusted class size amount will be 
    reconciled against the remaining amount and the pending amount. Pending will be removed
    while remaining amount will be adjusted as needed


Concrete Example
1. add 30 licenses for course 1
2. request 20 licenses for course 1 based on workshop request class size
3. 20 licenses are removed from "remaining" (leaving 10 available)
    and 20 are stored in pending
4. the workshop is finalized with a class size of 18 (two couldn't make it). 
    The pending amount is removed and 2 licenses are added back to the 
    remaining amount, bringing it up to 12
